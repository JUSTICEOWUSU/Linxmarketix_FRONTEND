        <h2 className={style.title}>1. Gather Your Tax Documents</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          The first step in preparing for tax season is to gather all the
          necessary tax documents. This includes your W-2 forms, 1099 forms, and
          any other relevant tax documents. These documents provide important
          information such as your income, deductions, and credits, which are
          used to calculate your tax liability or refund.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4">
          It’s important to ensure that all your tax documents are accurate and
          complete. Any errors or omissions could result in a delay in the
          processing of your tax return or even an audit. Take the time to
          review all your tax documents and make sure they are accurate and
          complete.

        <h2 className={style.title}>2. Review Your Tax Forms</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          Once you have gathered all your tax documents, the next step is to
          review your tax forms. This includes the Form 1040, which is the
          standard tax form used to file your federal income tax return. There
          are also other tax forms that you may need to file, depending on your
          individual tax situation.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          It’s important to review your tax forms carefully and ensure that all
          the information is accurate. If you are unsure about how to fill out a
          particular form or have questions about your tax situation, it may be
          helpful to consult with a tax professional.

        <h2 className={style.title}>3. Organize Your Receipts and Expenses</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          In addition to your tax documents and forms, it’s important to
          organize your receipts and expenses. This includes receipts for
          charitable donations, medical expenses, and business expenses.
          Organizing your receipts and expenses can help you identify deductions
          and credits that you may be eligible for, which can reduce your tax
          liability or increase your tax refund.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4">
          There are many tools available to help you organize your receipts and
          expenses, such as spreadsheets or tax preparation software. It’s
          important to keep accurate records of your receipts and expenses
          throughout the year, so you are prepared when tax season arrives.

        <h2 className={style.title}>4. Maximize Your Deductions and Credits</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          One of the best ways to reduce your tax liability or increase your tax
          refund is to maximize your deductions and credits. Deductions are
          expenses that can be subtracted from your income, while credits are
          amounts that can be directly applied to your tax liability.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4">
          Some common deductions include charitable donations, mortgage
          interest, and state and local taxes. Some common credits include the
          Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. It’s important to
          review all your tax documents and expenses to identify any deductions
          and credits that you may be eligible for.
        </p>

      <section className={style.point}>
        <h2 className={style.title}>5. File Your Taxes on Time</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          The final step in preparing for tax season is to file your taxes on
          time. The deadline to file your federal income tax return is typically
          April 15th, although this deadline may be extended in certain
          circumstances.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4">
          Filing your taxes on time is important to avoid penalties and interest
          charges. If you are unable to file your taxes on time, you may be able
          to request an extension. However, it’s important to note that an
          extension to file does not extend the deadline to pay any taxes owed.
