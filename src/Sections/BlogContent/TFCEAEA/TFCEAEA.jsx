        <h2 className={style.title}>1. Define your target audience</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          The first step in creating an effective video ad is to define your
          target audience. Understanding your audience's needs, interests, and
          pain points will help you create content that resonates with them.
          Start by researching your audience's demographics, psychographics, and
          behaviors. This information will help you create a video that speaks
          directly to your audience and drives engagement with your brand.

        <h2 className={style.title}>2. Tell a story</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          People love stories, and video is a powerful medium for storytelling.
          Instead of creating a sales pitch, focus on telling a story that will
          capture your audience's attention and engage them emotionally. Your
          story should be relatable, authentic, and memorable. Use your video to
          take your audience on a journey that will inspire them, entertain
          them, or educate them. A good story will help you build a connection
          with your audience and establish your brand's personality.

        <h2 className={style.title}>3. Keep it short and sweet</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          The attention span of today's digital audience is short. According to
          a study by Microsoft, the average attention span of a human is just
          eight seconds. This means that you have a limited amount of time to
          capture your audience's attention and deliver your message. Keep your
          video ad short and sweet. Ideally, your video should be less than 60
          seconds long. Use the first few seconds of your video to hook your
          audience and make them want to watch more.

      <section className={style.point}>
        <h2 className={style.title}>4. Use music and sound effects</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          Music and sound effects can help you create an emotional connection
          with your audience and enhance the overall impact of your video. Use
          music that complements your video's mood and tone. Consider using
          sound effects to add depth and texture to your video. Be careful not
          to use copyrighted music or sound effects without permission.

      <section className={style.point}>
        <h2 className={style.title}>5. Include a strong call-to-action</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          Your video ad should have a clear and compelling call-to-action (CTA)
          that tells your audience what you want them to do next. Your CTA
          should be relevant to your video's message and objective. Use
          action-oriented language and create a sense of urgency to encourage
          your audience to take action. Make it easy for your audience to take
          the next step by providing a clear path to conversion.

        <p className="my-4">
          Creating engaging and effective video ads takes time and effort, but
          it's worth it. By defining your target audience, telling a compelling
          story, keeping your video short and sweet, using music and sound
          effects, and including a strong call-to-action, you can create video
          ads that capture attention and drive results for your business.
          Remember to always test and iterate on your video ad strategy to
          continually improve your results.
