          the competition and connect with your target audience. One of the most
          effective ways to do this is through video marketing. Video marketing
          has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and for good
          reason. In this article, we'll explore why video marketing is so
          important for businesses, and how you can get started with your own

        <h2 className={style.title}>Why Video Marketing Matters</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
          Video marketing allows you to tell your brand's story in a way that no
          other form of marketing can. Video combines visual and auditory
          elements to create an emotional connection with your audience. With
          video, you can show your audience how your products or services work
          in real life, provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of your business, and
          much more.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          In addition, video is more engaging than other forms of content.
          Studies have shown that people are more likely to remember information
          presented in video format than in text format. Video also has the
          ability to evoke emotions, which can be a powerful tool for creating
          brand loyalty and driving sales.

            <strong>Keep it short and sweet:</strong> Attention spans are short,
            so aim to keep your videos under two minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use high-quality equipment:</strong> Your videos should look
            and sound professional, so invest in high-quality equipment if
            possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Include a call-to-action:</strong> Always include a
            call-to-action at the end of your videos, whether it's to visit your
            website, follow you on social media, or make a purchase.
          </li>
        </ul>
